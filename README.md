# For a Better Freer World

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Local development

To develop in this repository, first install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Next, cd into the app directory and install dependencies:

### `cd app`
### `npm install`

To preview the website locally, run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Once you have made your edits and are ready to publish them, run:

### `npm run deploy`

This builds the app for production and publishes it to the gh-pages branch in the repository. Once the deployment of that branch finishes, the website should be updated!
